Purplship Dashboard is a browser-based logistics and shipping orchestration dashboard for [purplship](https://github.com/purplship/purplship).

## Getting Started

### Using a Purplship Dashboard Release

If you just want to try Purplship out, check out the our [purplship/dashboard Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/purplship/dashboard) to give it a whirl.

### Building and Running Purplship Dashboard

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+
- A running instance of [purplship server](https://github.com/purplship/purplship).

#### Installing

Clone the repository

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/purplship/purplship-dashboard.git

cd purplship-dashboard

npm install
```

#### Configuration

Use the following environment variables to configure the dashboard:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PURPLSHIP_API_URL` (**required**) - URL of a running instance of purplship-server. If you are running purplship-server locally with the default settings, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PURPLSHIP_API_URL` to: `http://localhost:5002`.

- `JWT_SECRET` - A secret to use for JWT key generation - you should set this explicitly.

#### Development
