Purplship Dashboard is a browser-based logistics and shipping dashboard for [purplship](https://github.com/purplship/purplship).

## Getting Started

### Using a Purplship Dashboard Release

If you just want to try Purplship out, check out the [purplship/dashboard Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/purplship/dashboard) to give it a whirl.

### Building and Running Purplship Dashboard

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+
- A running instance of [purplship server](https://github.com/purplship/purplship).

#### Installing

Clone the repository

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/purplship/purplship-dashboard.git

cd purplship-dashboard

npm install
```

#### Configuration

Use the following environment variables to configure the dashboard:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PURPLSHIP_API_URL` (**required**) - URL of a running instance of purplship server. If you are running purplship-server locally with the default settings, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PURPLSHIP_API_URL` to: `http://localhost:5002`.

- `JWT_SECRET` (**required**) - A secret to use for JWT key generation - you should set this explicitly.

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` (**required**) - The URL of your dashboard to restrict the authentication host to your instance. If you are running the dashboard locally, set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to: `http://localhost:3000`.

- `PURPLSHIP_HOSTNAME` - URL of a running instance of purplship server. Useful for an internal network request from the node side of the dashboard. *Note: the default value will be `NEXT_PUBLIC_PURPLSHIP_API_URL` when not provided*

- `BASE_PATH` - A base path to use for deploying the dashboard to a domain subpath. e.g. `instance.purplship.com/dashboard`

#### Development

Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Purplship Dashboard should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### Production

Build the application bundle

```bash
npm run build
```
